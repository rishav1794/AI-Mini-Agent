Short-term memory is critical for conversational continuity.

This demo stores the last N messages per session in a database.
Those messages are injected back into the prompt for context.

Why only short-term memory?
Because:
- Long histories increase token cost.
- Irrelevant context hurts performance.
- Most conversations depend on recent turns.

In production, memory would likely be:
- Summarized periodically
- Indexed semantically
- Stored per user identity

Memory is not storage. It is context management.
