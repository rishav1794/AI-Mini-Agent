Invictus AI builds personalized AI agents.

An AI agent is not just a chatbot. A chatbot responds to input. An agent makes decisions.

In this system, an agent has:
- Conversational memory
- Access to structured tools
- A reasoning loop
- External knowledge retrieval

The difference is control.

Instead of blindly generating text, the agent can:
- Decide to call a function
- Retrieve relevant documents
- Persist state
- Respond based on structured outputs

An AI agent is essentially a small decision-making system powered by an LLM.
