Tool calling introduces determinism into an otherwise probabilistic system.

Instead of trusting the model to "figure it out" in text,
we give it structured tools like:

- calculate(expression)
- create_todo(task)
- list_todos()
- search_docs(query)

The model decides whether to call a tool.
If it does, the backend executes the tool.
The result is fed back into the model.

This pattern:
- Improves reliability
- Reduces hallucination
- Makes outputs auditable
- Enables real-world actions

LLMs generate language.
Tools create capability.
