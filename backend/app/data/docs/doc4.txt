Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual grounding.

The workflow in this demo:

1. Load local documents.
2. Chunk them.
3. Embed the chunks.
4. Embed the user query.
5. Retrieve top-k similar chunks.
6. Inject retrieved context into the system prompt.

This allows the agent to answer questions based on project-specific knowledge,
not just its pretraining.

RAG is a context injection strategy.
It is not a database.
It is not a search engine.
It is a relevance filter for prompt construction.
